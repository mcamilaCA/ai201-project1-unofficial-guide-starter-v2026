# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
It means the system has a 90% accuracy, which garantees user's get their answers most of the time.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
It ensures the user can double-check the statement if needed or where they can get more information if they come up with follow up questions. Plus it ensures the system is not creating knowledge but refering to the documentation.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
It makes the system honest and transparent, it is better to provide the user's with an honest answer than forcing the system to produce any answer.

---

## 4. None of the chunks cut mid-sentence or mid-word

All the chunks have to be complete sentences, and convey a full idea. The user has to be able to read and understand them, as well as find the response. 

**Why this target:**
I want to avoid the system using information to answer and not giving the user the proper explanation or source to look for the factual data the system shares.

## 5. System names all documents where information is found

In the data, there are multiple entries regarding the same information. For example, guide_eating provides information of several places and their dinning options, but documents specialized on the place might mention them too. If the system gatehr data from more than one source, it should state it - for at least 3 out of 5 tries, since some answers are found directly from one source.

**Why this target:**
It gives the user freedom to do its own research of a place or topic while guiding the right places to look for the information.

> **Revised in unit 2:** Same target (3 of 5), same intent — but measured by tracing
> whether each answer's specific claims appear in a cited document, not by comparing
> the count of retrieved files to the count of cited files.
>
> **Why revised:** My first pass measured this as retrieved-file-count vs.
> cited-file-count, which came out 0 of 5 every time — but top-k retrieval always
> pulls back more files than are actually used, so that count was always going to
> floor at 0 regardless of whether the system was honest about sources. It wasn't
> testing the thing I cared about. Reading each answer against the documents it
> drew from is slower but actually answers the question: does the system ever use
> a fact from a document it didn't cite?

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
