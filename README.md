# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
**Overlap:**

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

======================================================================
Chunk 1  |  source: guide_accessibility.md#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
# Getting around the region with limited mobility
## Overview

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are difficult and it is better to know in advance.

======================================================================
# Corry Vale
## What to see

The valley itself is the attraction. The footpath network is dense and well marked, and a circuit taking in three of the four villages is about nine miles with 500 metres of ascent. The chapel in the second village is 12th century and always unlocked.

======================================================================
Chunk 3  |  source: guide_givens_mill.md#4  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
# Givens Mill
## What to see

The mill runs tours on the hour from 11 to 3 and the machinery is operating during them, which is loud and much more impressive than a static exhibit. The church has a Saxon doorway. The river walk downstream reaches Brightwater in about three hours.

======================================================================
Chunk 4  |  source: guide_marchwood.md#3  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
# Marchwood
## Eat and drink

The best eating is in the Northgate district, a 12-minute tram ride from the station, where about thirty restaurants sit within four streets. The area immediately around the station is uniformly poor and expensive. Marchwood keeps later hours than anywhere elsein the region — kitchens serve until 10:30pm, and until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.

======================================================================
Chunk 5  |  source: guide_seasons.md#2  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
# When to visit the region
## Summer, June to August

June is excellent everywhere. July and August split: Halden Bay becomes very busy and the parking problem dominates, Kestrelford fills with walkers, and Brightwater goes quiet to the point of dullness with the university empty.

For each one, ask: could someone answer a question using only this,
without reading what came before or after?

# Brightwater
## Overview

Brightwater is a river town of about 40,000 people, roughly doubling in term time. It grew around a mill that closed in 1974 and spent twenty years working out what to be instead. The answer turned out to be the university.

[from guide_accessibility.md]
# Getting around the region with limited mobility
## Straightforward

**Brightwater** is level along the river and through the centre. The mill museum is step-free. The station is a 15-minute walk from campus on flat ground, or the shuttle meets the four busiest arrivals.

[from guide_marchwood.md]
# Marchwood
## Getting there

Every railway line in the region meets here, which is the city's defining feature. Trains to Brightwater run every 40 minutes until 11pm. The airport is 20 minutes out by a dedicated bus that runs every 15 minutes and costs more than the equivalent taxi shared between three people.

[from guide_brightwater.md]
# Brightwater
## Getting there

The train runs to the regional hub eleven times a day on weekdays and six times on Sundays, taking 50 minutes. The station is a 15-minute walk from campus, or the shuttle meets the four busiest arrivals. Long-distance coaches stop on Verrill Street rather than at the station, which catches people out. There is no airport; the nearest is 90 minutes by road.

[from guide_thornby_wells.md]
# Thornby Wells
## Getting there

On the Marchwood line, 25 minutes from the hub, with trains every hour and every two hours on Sundays. The station is in the centre. Driving from Brightwater is 45 minutes on good roads. Parking is free for two hours everywhere in town, which is unusual and generous.

Question: how many people are there in Brightwater?

Answer using only the documents above, and name the file you used.
======================================================================

Brightwater has a population of about 40,000 people, which roughly doubles during term time (from guide_brightwater.md).

**My relevance cutoff:**
THRESHOLD = 0.56

I chose this number as a threshold after the findings when testing the two groups: 
- Non-corpus questions best distance average: 0.7962
- Corpes questions best distance average: 0.4812

Even though the average of the corpus responses is 0.48 there are questions that are answered correctly and have a higher best distance that does not seem to surpase 0.56

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
